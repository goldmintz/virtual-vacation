# ðŸŽ¢  Welcome to Virtual Vacation ðŸŽ¡

During the Covid shutdown, I was missing the Disney parks, so I built this little music player to listen to my favorite ambient loops while I worked.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How It's Made

### Tech Stack
- React and Redux
- Local Storage
- CSS/SaSS styling
- Lightweight testing with Jest
- Audio files are locally hosted.


### Features
- Standard audio using HTML5 <audio>
- Shuffle and infinite play
- Navigate across 'lands'
- Full-screen imagery
- Favorites playlist using localstorage (so it persists)
